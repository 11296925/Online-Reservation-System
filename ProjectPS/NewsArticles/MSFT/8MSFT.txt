The March market crash created some amazing buying opportunities that many investors are likely kicking themselves for missing.  Village Farms InternationalÂ (NASDAQ: VFF) fell as low as $2.07 during the March market crash, and the cannabis company's stock has more than doubled since hitting that low point.  It may not reach that level again, but if the markets send Village Farms' stock down anywhere near that price, investors shouldn't hesitate to buy it.
