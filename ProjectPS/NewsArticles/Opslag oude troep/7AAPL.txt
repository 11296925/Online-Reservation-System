How This Apple iPhone Rumor Could Boost Sales
More
There has been a lot of chatter recently about some secondary details Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is working out for the next iPhone in terms of pricing and accessories.  The grapevine suggests that the next-generation device may come without an important accessory -- a power adapter -- and could also force buyers to invest in aftermarket (and potentially wireless) headphones as the box may be devoid of EarPods.  At the same time, there are rumors of Apple pricing the base model of the alleged iPhone 12 at a mouth-watering $549.
