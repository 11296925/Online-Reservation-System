Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) recently announced that it will permanently close all of its brick-and-mortar Microsoft Stores worldwide.  In a press release, Microsoft VP David Porter noted that the tech giant's "product portfolio has evolved to largely digital offerings, and our talented team has proven success serving customers beyond any physical location."  Microsoft stated that it wouldn't lay off any staff as part of the reorganization, and that it would continue paying its retail employees as they transferred to remote sales, training, and support positions.
